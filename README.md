## Abstract
This dissertation explores the application of deep learning techniques to differentiate friends from foes in urban irregular combat situations using images from computer games. The study utilizes the game Counter-Strike: Global Offensive to source image datasets and employs data augmentation to enhance the dataset. The research replicates and compares various deep learning models, including YOLO variants and encoder-decoder models, to identify combatants. Results indicate mixed effectiveness, with encoder-decoder models showing fewer losses and YOLO variants being more memory efficient. The study also examines the impact of data augmentation on model accuracy and the reduction of false positives and negatives.
